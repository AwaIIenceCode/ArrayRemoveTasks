# Array Remove Tasks

A C# console application for practicing array manipulation by removing elements from the start, end, and user-specified index.

## How to Run
1. `git clone https://github.com/AwaIIenceCode/ArrayRemoveTasks.git`
2. Open in Visual Studio or Rider.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Follow on-screen prompts to generate an array and remove elements.

## Features
- Generate random array (-21 to 21) with custom size (0-1000).
- Remove number from the end of the array.
- Remove number from the start of the array.
- Remove number from a user-specified index with input validation.
- Display the array after modifications.

## About
This task focuses on understanding array resizing, the `ref` keyword, and `Array.Copy` method for removal operations in C#.

## Future Work
- Add unit tests for validation and edge cases.
- Improve input handling with loops for invalid entries.
- Implement an `ArrayManipulator` class for better organization.
- Include a screenshot of the console output.
